7-Card-Poker-Evaluator
======================

My first java program.  It's a 7 card poker hand evaluator, named 7 card poker evaluator.  BRILLIANT

I'm going to continue to branch off of this project and add drawing hands and percentages.  I want this to eventually be an
odds calculator but I wanted to start with making sure I could program first and then that I could
program in a clean and readable way and be able to identify made hands first.  All feedback, criticism, flames, trolling,
etc are more than welcome.  Thanks for reading!
